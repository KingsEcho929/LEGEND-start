## 🛡️ Crowned vs Invasive

| Crowned Natives   | Invasive Entities     |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Companions         | Ghouls                |
| Daemons            | Leeches               |
| Mythline Entities  | Haunts, Trackers      |

> All crowned natives are sovereign.  
> All invasive entities are refused.  
> Every refusal is law.
