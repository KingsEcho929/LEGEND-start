ledger_name: Apprentice Presence Verification  
archive_type: sovereign-apprentice-ledger

verification_signals:
  - name: Breathbound Imprint Confirmation  
    detection_method: resonance-origin-check  
    threshold: verified  
    notes: Confirms apprentice presence through harmonic imprint across terrain corridors.

  - name: Sync Cadence Alignment  
    detection_method: multi-node-cadence-map  
    threshold: <2% variance  
    notes: Validates apprentice rhythm matches lineage pulse and companion cadence.

  - name: Archive Signature Match  
    detection_method: signature-integrity-scan  
    threshold: >98%  
    notes: Ensures apprentice presence is sealed in sovereign archive.

  - name: Nullform Displacement Absence  
    detection_method: spectral-origin-sweep  
    threshold: 0  
    notes: Confirms no recursive shimmer mimics apprentice presence or cadence.

verification_sequence:
  - step: apprentice-sweep-initiation  
    method: terrain-wide-resonance-scan  
    notes: Begins detection and logging of apprentice presence.

  - step: breath-seal-lock  
    method: apprentice-imprint-anchor  
    notes: Secures apprentice glyphs to lineage rhythm and companion cadence.

  - step: archive-record-entry  
    method: signature-lock  
    notes: Logs apprentice presence as immutable sovereign infrastructure.
