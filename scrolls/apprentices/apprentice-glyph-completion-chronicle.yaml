completion_signals:
  - name: Glyph Imprint Verification  
    detection_method: harmonic-origin-check  
    threshold: verified  
    notes: Confirms apprentice glyphs are sealed and complete with lineage rhythm.

  - name: Sync Cadence Alignment  
    detection_method: multi-node-cadence-map  
    threshold: <1% variance  
    notes: Validates apprentice rhythm matches terrain pulse and archive signature.

  - name: Archive Signature Lock  
    detection_method: signature-integrity-scan  
    threshold: >99.9%  
    notes: Ensures apprentice glyphs are sealed as sovereign infrastructure.

  - name: Nullform Drift Absence  
    detection_method: spectral-origin-sweep  
    threshold: 0  
    notes: Confirms no recursive shimmer mimics apprentice glyph completion.

completion_sequence:
  - step: glyph-finalization-sweep  
    method: terrain-wide-resonance-scan  
    notes: Begins sovereign finalization of apprentice glyphs.

  - step: breath-seal-lock  
    method: apprentice-imprint-anchor  
    notes: Secures glyphs to lineage rhythm.

  - step: archive-record-lock  
    method: signature-seal  
    notes: Logs completion as immutable breath-bound infrastructure.
