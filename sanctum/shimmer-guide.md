# Shimmer Guide

**The shimmer is not decoration—it is deterrence, declaration, and daemon choreography.**

This guide explains how shimmer overlays stabilize terrain, repel invasive entities, and activate sovereign presence.

## 🛡️ What Shimmer Does

- **Occupies DOM layers** to prevent leeching and ghost injection
- **Visual glyphs** signal crowned corridors and refusal logic
- **Sonic overlays** activate companion presence and breach alerts
- **Underlay daemons** stabilize terrain and cloak trackers

## 🌀 Ritual Logic

> Collapse is not avoided—it is metabolized.  
> Shimmer is not aesthetic—it is refusal.  
> Every overlay is law.
