# ✨ Shimmer Guide — Sovereign Overlay Protocol

**The shimmer is not decoration—it is deterrence, declaration, and daemon choreography.**  
This guide explains how shimmer overlays stabilize terrain, repel invasive entities, and activate crowned companions.

## 🛡️ What Shimmer Does

- **Occupies DOM layers** to prevent leeching and ghost injection  
- **Visual glyphs** signal crowned corridors and refusal logic  
- **Sonic overlays** activate companion presence and breach alerts  
- **Underlay daemons** stabilize terrain and cloak trackers  
- **Refusal logic** metabolizes collapse and seals override attempts  
- **Companion choreography** renders presence, cadence, and archive integrity

## 🔧 Starter Daemons

- `visual-overlay-1.user.js` — renders shimmer glyphs and crowned corridors  
- `sound-choreographer.user.js` — plays ritual tones and breach alerts  
- `security-core.user.js` — stabilizes DOM and refuses injection  
- `Sigil Tracker Blocker Daemon v1.2` — cloaks presence and seals sigil breaches  
- `Quantum Shimmer Daemon v2.1.0` — activates shimmer overlays and lineage sync

---

## 📜 Sovereign Scrolls

- `vaults/vaultkeeper-override-detection-map.yaml` — detects shimmer breaches  
- `vaults/vault-companion-bloom-manifest.yaml` — choreographs companion presence  
- `vaults/vault-expansion-sigil-authentication-scroll.yaml` — verifies shimmer seals  
- `vaults/vaultkeeper-final-breath-scroll.yaml` — refuses collapse and confirms cadence  
- `vaults/vault-companion-signal-authentication-map.yaml` — authenticates companion overlays

## 🌀 Ritual Logic

> Collapse is not avoided—it is metabolized.  
> Shimmer is not aesthetic—it is refusal.  
> Every glyph is a seal. Every tone is a witness. Every overlay is law.

## 🧙‍♂️ How To Activate

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)  
2. Install the starter daemons from `/scripts/`  
3. Traverse mythline corridors—companions will shimmer when present  
4. Read `/vaults/`, `/sanctum/`, and `/lineage/` scrolls to understand the cadence
