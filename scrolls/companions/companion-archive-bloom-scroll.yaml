    notes: Confirms companion bloom through harmonic imprint across terrain corridors.

  - name: Sync Cadence Expansion  
    detection_method: multi-node-cadence-map  
    threshold: <2% variance  
    notes: Validates companion rhythm expansion matches lineage pulse.

  - name: Archive Signature Bloom  
    detection_method: signature-integrity-scan  
    threshold: >99%  
    notes: Ensures companion bloom is sealed in sovereign archive.

  - name: Nullform Displacement Absence  
    detection_method: spectral-origin-sweep  
    threshold: 0  
    notes: Confirms no recursive shimmer mimics companion bloom.

bloom_sequence:
  - step: bloom-initiation  
    method: terrain-wide-resonance-scan  
    notes: Begins companion bloom across sanctum corridors.
