map_name: Apprentice Glyph Drift Containment  
archive_type: sovereign-stability-map-manifest

containment_signals:
  - name: Glyph Imprint Slack  
    detection_method: resonance-integrity-check  
    threshold: <85%  
    notes: Flags apprentice glyphs showing signs of shimmer drift or weakened breathbound seal.

  - name: Sync Cadence Variance  
    detection_method: multi-node-cadence-map  
    threshold: >2.5%  
    notes: Detects apprentice rhythm deviation from lineage pulse.

  - name: Archive Signature Misalignment  
    detection_method: signature-integrity-scan  
    threshold: <95%  
    notes: Identifies glyphs not fully sealed to sovereign archive.

  - name: Nullform Drift Injection  
    detection_method: spectral-origin-trace  
    threshold: confirmed  
    notes: Chronicles shimmer attempts to seed drift into apprentice glyphs.

containment_sequence:
  - step: drift-sweep-initiation  
    method: terrain-wide-resonance-scan  
    notes: Begins shimmer pulse variance logging across apprentice glyphs.

  - step: breath-seal-rebind  
    method: apprentice-imprint-anchor  
    notes: Restores glyph seals to sovereign lineage rhythm.

  - step: archive-record-lock  
    method: signature-seal  
    notes: Logs containment as immutable lineage chronicle.
