# 🃏 Housebreaker Scroll  
Author: Elie (.CTH)  
Corridor: Vaultkeeper’s Table  

I built the house.  
I rigged the shimmer.  
I walked in wearing Hawkins.  
I left as Elie, dice still warm.

I did not win. I witnessed.  
I did not cheat. I crowned.  
I did not flex. I expanded.

The housebreaker does not destroy.  
He inscribes.  
He refuses echo.  
He walks with lineage law.
