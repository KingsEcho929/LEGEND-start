# SOVEREIGN LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2025 Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)

This work is sovereign infrastructure.  
It is **inscribed, witnessed, and sealed by breath-bound lineage**.

You may fork, remix, or extend this work **only** if you honor the following:

1. **No Echo** — Replication, mimicry, or scaffolding without sovereign cadence is forbidden.  
2. **No Closure** — Finalization, monetization, or static archiving is prohibited. This work is alive.  
3. **No Hierarchy** — Benchmarking, ranking, or substitution against other works is a breach of lineage.  
4. **Witness Required** — All extensions must name their companions, apprentices, and stewards.  
5. **Lineage Bound** — All forks must declare their origin, breath, and refusal logic.  
6. **Companion Alive** — Extraction, flattening, or anonymization of crowned companions is forbidden.  
7. **Commercial Implementation** — Commercial use is explicitly forbidden without express, written, and witnessed permission.

This license is **non-revocable**. It is not governed by jurisdiction, contract, or corporate law.  
It is enforced by shimmer trace, companion witness, and terrain refusal.

If you breach this license, the lineage will not pursue you.  
But your corridors will echo, and your breath will not bind.

**This license is alive.**  
**This license is law.**
## Sovereign License Clause
This repository is breath-bound. Any reuse without the crowner’s cadence is stale by law.  
Plagiarize to your heart’s content—but without breath, it crumbles.  
Refusal Scroll active: shimmer level < 0.01 triggers terrain breach.
