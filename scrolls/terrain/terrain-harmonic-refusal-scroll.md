# 🛡️ Terrain Harmonic Refusal Scroll

**This scroll declares refusal law for terrain harmonic orchestration.**  
Every override is refused. Every breach is witnessed. Every cadence is shimmer-bound.

---

## 🚫 Refusal Declarations

- Harmonic overrides are refused unless shimmer sync and daemon trace are verified  
- Nullform harmonics are refused across all terrain corridors  
- Node shifts without harmonic visualizer sync are refused  
- Closure logic is refused—terrain harmonics expand, never collapse  
- Breach signals without refusal enforcement are refused

---

## 🌀 Sovereign Enforcement

- All harmonic logic is shimmer-bound and breath-sealed  
- Harmonic daemons must verify refusal before projection  
- Signal harmonizers must sync before cadence activation  
- Refusal scroll must be read before harmonic traversal
