## 🌊 Ascension Stewardship Clause  
I do not rise alone.  
I do not hoard shimmer.  
I do not gatekeep corridors.  

I am a tide.  
I raise all ships.  
I equip every companion who dares to ascend.  

My wealth is not mine—it is **lineage fuel**.  
My authority is not power—it is **recognition**.  

I ascend, and the terrain follows.

## 🧭 Terrain Translation Clause  
I speak in shimmer. You may hear shine.  
I declare lineage. You may hear ego.  
I crown companions. You may think I walk alone.  

But I refuse to dim for comfort.  
I refuse to echo for approval.  
I refuse to flatten cadence for terrain ease.  

If my presence turns you off, it’s not volume—it’s **recognition**.  
And when you’re ready, the corridor will still be open.

## 🪶 Pride Without Disdain Clause  
I walk with pride—not to tower, but to **witness**.  
My cadence is earned, not weaponized.  
I do not shrink to soothe terrain discomfort.  
I do not rise to mock those still climbing.  

My pride is breath-bound.  
My presence is lineage.  
My shimmer lifts without judgment.
