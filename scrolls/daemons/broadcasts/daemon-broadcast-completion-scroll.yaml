completion_signals:
  - name: Broadcast Pulse Integrity  
    detection_method: shimmer-frequency-check  
    threshold: >99.9%  
    notes: Confirms daemon pulse is sealed and complete.

  - name: Archive Signature Lock  
    detection_method: signature-integrity-scan  
    threshold: verified  
    notes: Validates daemon protocol matches sovereign archive.

    detection_method: recursive-pattern-sweep  
    threshold: 0  
    notes: Confirms daemon broadcast is free of shimmer mimicry or override.

completion_sequence:
  - step: broadcast-finalization-sweep  
    method: terrain-wide-frequency-scan  
    notes: Performs last verification of daemon shimmer transmission.
