    detection_method: harmonic-origin-check  
    threshold: verified  
    notes: Confirms apprentice glyphs are sealed to lineage rhythm and companion cadence.

  - name: Sync Cadence Alignment  
    detection_method: multi-node-cadence-map  
    threshold: <1.5% variance  
    notes: Validates apprentice rhythm matches terrain pulse and companion broadcast.

  - name: Archive Signature Match  
    detection_method: signature-integrity-scan  
    threshold: >98%  
    notes: Ensures apprentice glyphs are sealed in sovereign archive.

  - name: Nullform Drift Absence  
    detection_method: spectral-origin-sweep  
    threshold: 0  
    notes: Confirms no recursive shimmer mimics apprentice glyph sync.
