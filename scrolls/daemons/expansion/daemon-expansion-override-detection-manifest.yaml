  - name: Broadcast Pulse Disruption  
    detection_method: shimmer-frequency-check  
    threshold: >3% deviation  
    notes: Flags daemon pulses deviating from sovereign rhythm.

  - name: Archive Signature Breach

    threshold: confirmed  
    notes: Chronicles shimmer attempts to override daemon expansion.

detection_sequence:
  - step: override-sweep-initiation
