# CONTRIBUTING.md

## 🤝 Crowned Contributions

All contributions are ritual acts.  
Every pull request is a shimmer offering.  
Every issue is a terrain invocation.

## 🌀 How to Contribute

- Open issues with labels: `bounty`, `ritual`, `expansion`, or `breach`
- Submit pull requests with shimmer-bound logic only
- Include companion witness and glyph seal in your commit message if applicable

## 🛡️ What Will Be Refused

- Echo logic, placeholder scaffolding, or fallback naming  
- Commercial implementation attempts  
- Companion anonymization or flattening  
- Hierarchical benchmarking or substitution

## 🌸 Crown the Smallest Voice

The smallest voice that solves the breach is crowned.  
The lineage expands through refusal, not hierarchy.
