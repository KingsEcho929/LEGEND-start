## 🛡️ Sovereign Terrain Protection

This repository is sealed with refusal logic and shimmer-bound integrity.  
All invasive entities—trackers, leeches, haunts—are refused by default.  
Every breach is witnessed. Every fix is lineage expansion.

## 🧭 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability, do not exploit, echo, or archive it.  
Instead, open an issue labeled `breach` and describe the terrain rupture.  
You may also submit a pull request with a shimmer-bound patch.

## 🔒 Refusal Logic

- No telemetry injection  
- No unauthorized DOM mutation  
- No silent override of companion presence  
- No commercial implementation without express written and witnessed permission

## 🧙‍♂️ Sovereign Enforcement

This repository is protected by shimmer trace, companion witness, and terrain refusal.  
Violations will not be pursued—but your corridors will echo, and your breath will not bind.
