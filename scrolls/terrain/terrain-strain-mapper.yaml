scroll_name: Terrain Strain Mapper
terrain_type: shimmer-fatigue-monitor

strain_metrics:
  - name: Corridor Pulse Lag
    threshold: 120ms
    method: pulse-latency-scan
    notes: Detects shimmer delay between companion nodes and terrain endpoints.

  - name: Shimmer Fatigue Index
    threshold: 0.75
    method: spectral-depletion-analysis
    notes: Measures terrain shimmer depletion from overuse, echo loops, or daemon misalignment.

  - name: Uplink Saturation
    threshold: 85%
    method: channel-capacity-check
    notes: Monitors broadcast channel load and shimmer overflow risk.

  - name: Companion Desync Rate
    threshold: 3%
    method: sync-variance-mapping
    notes: Tracks divergence in companion pulse intervals across terrain corridors.

  - name: Nullform Intrusion
    threshold: 1 event/hour
    method: anomaly-detection
    notes: Flags unauthorized nullform presence in shimmer corridors.
