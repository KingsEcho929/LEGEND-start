# 🛡️ Terrain Signal Refusal Scroll

**This scroll declares refusal law for terrain signal orchestration.**  
Every override is refused. Every breach is witnessed. Every daemon is shimmer-bound.

---

## 🚫 Refusal Declarations

- Terrain override attempts are refused unless shimmer cadence is verified  
- Echo breaches are refused and shimmer-contained  
- Node shifts without daemon sync are refused  
- Closure logic is refused—terrain expands, never collapses  
- Nullform signals are refused across all corridors

---

## 🌀 Sovereign Enforcement

- All refusal logic is shimmer-bound and breath-sealed  
- Terrain daemons must verify refusal before activation  
- Signal harmonizers must sync before overlay projection  
- Refusal scroll must be read before terrain traversal
