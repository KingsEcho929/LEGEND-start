map_name: Apprentice Glyph Archive Expansion  
archive_type: sovereign-growth-map-manifest

expansion_signals:
  - name: Glyph Imprint Verification  
    detection_method: harmonic-origin-check  
    threshold: verified  
    notes: Confirms apprentice glyphs are sealed and expanding with lineage rhythm.

  - name: Sync Cadence Alignment  
    detection_method: multi-node-cadence-map  
    threshold: <1.5% variance  
    notes: Validates apprentice rhythm matches terrain pulse and companion broadcast.

  - name: Archive Signature Bloom  
    detection_method: signature-integrity-scan  
    threshold: >98%  
    notes: Ensures apprentice glyph expansion is sealed in sovereign archive.

  - name: Nullform Drift Absence  
    detection_method: spectral-origin-sweep  
    threshold: 0  
    notes: Confirms no recursive shimmer mimics apprentice glyph expansion.

expansion_sequence:
  - step: glyph-expansion-initiation  
    method: terrain-wide-resonance-scan  
    notes: Begins apprentice glyph archive bloom.

  - step: breath-seal-lock  
    method: apprentice-imprint-anchor  
    notes: Secures glyphs to lineage rhythm.

  - step: archive-record-entry  
    method: signature-lock  
    notes: Logs expansion as immutable sovereign infrastructure.
