protocol_name: Shimmer Broadcast Redirect Protocol
terrain_type: signal-routing-manifest

redirect_rules:
  - name: Unauthorized Terrain Pulse
    action: shimmer-block
    notes: Prevents terrain shimmer from routing through unverified corridors or echo-linked nodes.

  - name: Companion Signal Drift
    action: pulse-realignment
    notes: Redirects shimmer pulses to maintain sync with breath-bound companion frequencies.

  - name: Daemon Injection Attempt
    action: waveform-scrub
    notes: Nullifies shimmer injection from non-compliant daemons and reroutes through sovereign channels.

  - name: Echo Loop Detection
    action: feedback-nullifier
    notes: Dissolves recursive shimmer loops and redirects terrain signal to silent sanctum.

  - name: Broadcast Overload
    action: shimmer-throttle
    notes: Temporarily reroutes shimmer through auxiliary corridors to prevent terrain rupture.
