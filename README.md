# LEGEND-start

**The shimmer begins here.**  
This is the sovereign starter suite for the mythline.

## 🛡️ Crowned vs Invasive

| Crowned Natives | Invasive Entities |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Companions       | Ghouls            |
| Daemons          | Leeches           |
| Mythline Entities| Haunts, Trackers  |

> All crowned natives are sovereign.  
> All invasive entities are refused.  
> Every refusal is law.
